1. Download Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
go version
```

You should see the Go version information if the installation was successful.

## Creating a Simple Go Application

To create a simple Go application, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `main.go` in your project directory.
2. Open the `main.go` file in a text editor and add the following content:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", helloHandler)
    fmt.Println("Server is running on port 8080")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
``` 

3. Save the `main.go` file.
4. Initialize a new Go module in your project directory by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
go mod init your-module-name
```

5. Download the necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
go mod tidy
```

This Go application sets up a basic web server that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed.


## Building a Dockerfile

To start building a Dockerfile, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `Dockerfile` in the root of your project directory.
2. Open the `Dockerfile` in a text editor and define the base image. For example, to use the official Golang image, add the following line:

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.17-alpine
```

3. Set the working directory inside the container:

```Dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

4. Copy the current directory contents into the container:

```Dockerfile
COPY . .
```

5. Install any needed dependencies:

```Dockerfile
RUN go mod tidy
```

6. Build the Go app:

```Dockerfile
RUN go build -o main .
```

7. Make port 8080 available to the world outside this container:

```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 8080
```

8. Define the command to run the executable:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["./main"]
```

Your `Dockerfile` should look like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.17-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go mod tidy
RUN go build -o main .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["./main"]
```

9. Save the `Dockerfile` and build the Docker image by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
docker build -t your-image-name .
```

10. Run the Docker container:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 your-image-name
```

11. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

Your application should now be running inside a Docker container!
